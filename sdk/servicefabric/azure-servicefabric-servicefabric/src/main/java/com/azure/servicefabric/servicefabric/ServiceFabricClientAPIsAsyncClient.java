     * Service Fabric REST API version is based on the runtime version in which the API was introduced or was changed. Service Fabric runtime supports more than one version of the API. This is the latest supported version of the API. If a lower API version is passed, the returned response may be different from the one documented in this specification.
     *
     * Additionally the runtime accept any version that is higher than the latest supported version up to the current version of the runtime. So if the latest API version is 6.0, but if the runtime is 6.1, in order to make it easier to write the clients, the runtime will accept version 6.1 for that API. However the behavior of the API will be as per the documented 6.0 version.

     *     <tr><td>Immediate</td><td>String</td><td>No</td><td>A flag that indicates whether the report should be sent immediately.
     * A health report is sent to a Service Fabric gateway Application, which forwards to the health store.
     * If Immediate is set to true, the report is sent immediately from HTTP Gateway to the health store, regardless of the fabric client settings that the HTTP Gateway Application is using.
     * This is useful for critical reports that should be sent as soon as possible.
     * Depending on timing and other conditions, sending the report may still fail, for example if the HTTP Gateway is closed or the message doesn't reach the Gateway.
     * If Immediate is set to false, the report is sent based on the health client settings from the HTTP Gateway. Therefore, it will be batched according to the HealthReportSendInterval configuration.
     * This is the recommended setting because it allows the health client to optimize health reporting messages to health store as well as health report processing.
     * By default, reports are not sent immediately.

     *
     * Additionally the runtime accept any version that is higher than the latest supported version up to the current version of the runtime. So if the latest API version is 6.0, but if the runtime is 6.1, in order to make it easier to write the clients, the runtime will accept version 6.1 for that API. However the behavior of the API will be as per the documented 6.0 version.

This is the latest supported version of the API. If a lower API version is passed, the returned response may be different from the one documented in this specification.
     *
     * Additionally the runtime accept any version that is higher than the latest supported version up to the current version of the runtime. So if the latest API version is 6.0, but if the runtime is 6.1, in order to make it easier to write the clients, the runtime will accept version 6.1 for that API. However the behavior of the API will be as per the documented 6.0 version.

     *     <tr><td>Immediate</td><td>String</td><td>No</td><td>A flag that indicates whether the report should be sent immediately.
     * A health report is sent to a Service Fabric gateway Application, which forwards to the health store.
     * If Immediate is set to true, the report is sent immediately from HTTP Gateway to the health store, regardless of the fabric client settings that the HTTP Gateway Application is using.
     * This is useful for critical reports that should be sent as soon as possible.
     * Depending on timing and other conditions, sending the report may still fail, for example if the HTTP Gateway is closed or the message doesn't reach the Gateway.
     * If Immediate is set to false, the report is sent based on the health client settings from the HTTP Gateway. Therefore, it will be batched according to the HealthReportSendInterval configuration.
     * This is the recommended setting because it allows the health client to optimize health reporting messages to health store as well as health report processing.
     * By default, reports are not sent immediately.

     * This is useful for critical reports that should be sent as soon as possible.
     * Depending on timing and other conditions, sending the report may still fail, for example if the HTTP Gateway is closed or the message doesn't reach the Gateway.
     * If Immediate is set to false, the report is sent based on the health client settings from the HTTP Gateway. Therefore, it will be batched according to the HealthReportSendInterval configuration.
     * This is the recommended setting because it allows the health client to optimize health reporting messages to health store as well as health report processing.

     *     <tr><td>Immediate</td><td>String</td><td>No</td><td>A flag that indicates whether the report should be sent immediately.
     * A health report is sent to a Service Fabric gateway Application, which forwards to the health store.
     * If Immediate is set to true, the report is sent immediately from HTTP Gateway to the health store, regardless of the fabric client settings that the HTTP Gateway Application is using.
     * This is useful for critical reports that should be sent as soon as possible.
     * Depending on timing and other conditions, sending the report may still fail, for example if the HTTP Gateway is closed or the message doesn't reach the Gateway.
     * If Immediate is set to false, the report is sent based on the health client settings from the HTTP Gateway. Therefore, it will be batched according to the HealthReportSendInterval configuration.
     * This is the recommended setting because it allows the health client to optimize health reporting messages to health store as well as health report processing.
     * By default, reports are not sent immediately.

     *     <tr><td>Immediate</td><td>String</td><td>No</td><td>A flag that indicates whether the report should be sent immediately.
     * A health report is sent to a Service Fabric gateway Application, which forwards to the health store.
     * If Immediate is set to true, the report is sent immediately from HTTP Gateway to the health store, regardless of the fabric client settings that the HTTP Gateway Application is using.
     * This is useful for critical reports that should be sent as soon as possible.
     * Depending on timing and other conditions, sending the report may still fail, for example if the HTTP Gateway is closed or the message doesn't reach the Gateway.
     * If Immediate is set to false, the report is sent based on the health client settings from the HTTP Gateway. Therefore, it will be batched according to the HealthReportSendInterval configuration.
     * This is the recommended setting because it allows the health client to optimize health reporting messages to health store as well as health report processing.
     * By default, reports are not sent immediately.

     *
     * Additionally the runtime accept any version that is higher than the latest supported version up to the current version of the runtime. So if the latest API version is 6.0, but if the runtime is 6.1, in order to make it easier to write the clients, the runtime will accept version 6.1 for that API. However the behavior of the API will be as per the documented 6.0 version.

     * A health report is sent to a Service Fabric gateway Application, which forwards to the health store.

     * This is useful for critical reports that should be sent as soon as possible.
     * Depending on timing and other conditions, sending the report may still fail, for example if the HTTP Gateway is closed or the message doesn't reach the Gateway.
     * If Immediate is set to false, the report is sent based on the health client settings from the HTTP Gateway. Therefore, it will be batched according to the HealthReportSendInterval configuration.
     * This is the recommended setting because it allows the health client to optimize health reporting messages to health store as well as health report processing.

     * removal closes the replica, transitions the replica to the role None, and then removes all of the state
     * information of the replica from the cluster. This API tests the replica state removal path, and simulates the
     * report fault permanent path through client APIs. Warning - There are no safety checks performed when this API is
     * used. Incorrect use of this API can lead to data loss for stateful services. In addition, the forceRemove flag
     * impacts all other replicas hosted in the same process.

     * Reports health state of the service package of the application deployed on a Service Fabric node. The report must

     *     <tr><td>api-version</td><td>String</td><td>Yes</td><td>The version of the API. This parameter is required and its value must be '6.0'.
     *
     * Service Fabric REST API version is based on the runtime version in which the API was introduced or was changed. Service Fabric runtime supports more than one version of the API. This is the latest supported version of the API. If a lower API version is passed, the returned response may be different from the one documented in this specification.
     *
     * Additionally the runtime accept any version that is higher than the latest supported version up to the current version of the runtime. So if the latest API version is 6.0, but if the runtime is 6.1, in order to make it easier to write the clients, the runtime will accept version 6.1 for that API. However the behavior of the API will be as per the documented 6.0 version.
     * </td></tr>
     *     <tr><td>Immediate</td><td>String</td><td>No</td><td>A flag that indicates whether the report should be sent immediately.
     * A health report is sent to a Service Fabric gateway Application, which forwards to the health store.
     * If Immediate is set to true, the report is sent immediately from HTTP Gateway to the health store, regardless of the fabric client settings that the HTTP Gateway Application is using.
     * This is useful for critical reports that should be sent as soon as possible.
     * Depending on timing and other conditions, sending the report may still fail, for example if the HTTP Gateway is closed or the message doesn't reach the Gateway.
     * If Immediate is set to false, the report is sent based on the health client settings from the HTTP Gateway. Therefore, it will be batched according to the HealthReportSendInterval configuration.
     * This is the recommended setting because it allows the health client to optimize health reporting messages to health store as well as health report processing.
     * By default, reports are not sent immediately.

     * This API will induce data loss for the specified partition. It will trigger a call to the OnDataLoss API of the
     * partition. Actual data loss will depend on the specified DataLossMode.
     *
     * <p>- PartialDataLoss - Only a quorum of replicas are removed and OnDataLoss is triggered for the partition but
     * actual data loss depends on the presence of in-flight replication. - FullDataLoss - All replicas are removed
     * hence all data is lost and OnDataLoss is triggered.
     *
     * <p>This API should only be called with a stateful service as the target.
     *
     * <p>Calling this API with a system service as the target is not advised.
     *
     * <p>Note: Once this API has been called, it cannot be reversed. Calling CancelOperation will only stop execution
     * and clean up internal system state. It will not restore data if the command has progressed far enough to cause
     * data loss.
