     * <p>Specifying a value for <code>HealthCheckId</code> is useful only when Route 53 is choosing between two or more
     * resource record sets to respond to a DNS query, and you want Route 53 to base the choice in part on the status of
     * a health check. Configuring health checks makes sense only in the following configurations:</p> <ul> <li> <p>
     * <b>Non-alias resource record sets</b>: You're checking the health of a group of non-alias resource record sets
     * that have the same routing policy, name, and type (such as multiple weighted records named www.example.com with a
     * type of A) and you specify health check IDs for all the resource record sets. </p> <p>If the health check status
     * for a resource record set is healthy, Route 53 includes the record among the records that it responds to DNS
     * queries with.</p> <p>If the health check status for a resource record set is unhealthy, Route 53 stops responding
     * to DNS queries using the value for that resource record set.</p> <p>If the health check status for all resource
     * record sets in the group is unhealthy, Route 53 considers all resource record sets in the group healthy and
     * responds to DNS queries accordingly. </p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Alias resource record sets</b>: You specify the
     * following settings:</p> <ul> <li> <p>You set <code>EvaluateTargetHealth</code> to true for an alias resource
     * record set in a group of resource record sets that have the same routing policy, name, and type (such as multiple
     * weighted records named www.example.com with a type of A). </p> </li> <li> <p>You configure the alias resource
     * record set to route traffic to a non-alias resource record set in the same hosted zone.</p> </li> <li> <p>You
     * specify a health check ID for the non-alias resource record set. </p> </li> </ul> <p>If the health check status
     * is healthy, Route 53 considers the alias resource record set to be healthy and includes the alias record among
     * the records that it responds to DNS queries with.</p> <p>If the health check status is unhealthy, Route 53 stops
     * responding to DNS queries using the alias resource record set.</p> <note> <p>The alias resource record set can
     * also route traffic to a <i>group</i> of non-alias resource record sets that have the same routing policy, name,
     * and type. In that configuration, associate health checks with all of the resource record sets in the group of
     * non-alias resource record sets.</p> </note> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Geolocation Routing</b> </p> <p>For geolocation
     * resource record sets, if an endpoint is unhealthy, Route 53 looks for a resource record set for the larger,
     * associated geographic region. For example, suppose you have resource record sets for a state in the United
     * States, for the entire United States, for North America, and a resource record set that has <code>*</code> for
     * <code>CountryCode</code> is <code>*</code>, which applies to all locations. If the endpoint for the state
     * resource record set is unhealthy, Route 53 checks for healthy resource record sets in the following order until
     * it finds a resource record set for which the endpoint is healthy:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The United States</p> </li>
     * <li> <p>North America</p> </li> <li> <p>The default resource record set</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Specifying the
     * Health Check Endpoint by Domain Name</b> </p> <p>If your health checks specify the endpoint only by domain name,
     * we recommend that you create a separate health check for each endpoint. For example, create a health check for
     * each <code>HTTP</code> server that is serving content for <code>www.example.com</code>. For the value of
     * <code>FullyQualifiedDomainName</code>, specify the domain name of the server (such as
     * <code>us-east-2-www.example.com</code>), not the name of the resource record sets
     * (<code>www.example.com</code>).</p> <important> <p>Health check results will be unpredictable if you do the
     * following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Create a health check that has the same value for
     * <code>FullyQualifiedDomainName</code> as the name of a resource record set.</p> </li> <li> <p>Associate that
     * health check with the resource record set.</p> </li> </ul> </important>

     * <code>true</code> for <code>MultiValueAnswer</code>. Note the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>If you associate a
     * health check with a multivalue answer resource record set, Amazon Route 53 responds to DNS queries with the
     * corresponding IP address only when the health check is healthy.</p> </li> <li> <p>If you don't associate a health
     * check with a multivalue answer record, Route 53 always considers the record to be healthy.</p> </li> <li>
     * <p>Route 53 responds to DNS queries with up to eight healthy records; if you have eight or fewer healthy records,
     * Route 53 responds to all DNS queries with all the healthy records.</p> </li> <li> <p>If you have more than eight
     * healthy records, Route 53 responds to different DNS resolvers with different combinations of healthy records.</p>
     * </li> <li> <p>When all records are unhealthy, Route 53 responds to DNS queries with up to eight unhealthy

     * resource record sets&lt;/b&gt;: You specify the following settings:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;You
     * set &lt;code&gt;EvaluateTargetHealth&lt;/code&gt; to true for an alias resource record set in a group of resource

     * record set to route traffic to a non-alias resource record set in the same hosted zone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
     * &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;You specify a health check ID for the non-alias resource record set. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
     * &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;If the health check status is healthy, Route 53 considers the alias resource record set to
     * be healthy and includes the alias record among the records that it responds to DNS queries with.&lt;/p&gt;
     * &lt;p&gt;If the health check status is unhealthy, Route 53 stops responding to DNS queries using the alias
     * resource record set.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;note&gt; &lt;p&gt;The alias resource record set can also route traffic to a
     * &lt;i&gt;group&lt;/i&gt; of non-alias resource record sets that have the same routing policy, name, and type. In
     * that configuration, associate health checks with all of the resource record sets in the group of non-alias
     * resource record sets.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/note&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Geolocation
     * Routing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For geolocation resource record sets, if an endpoint is unhealthy, Route 53
     * looks for a resource record set for the larger, associated geographic region. For example, suppose you have
     * resource record sets for a state in the United States, for the entire United States, for North America, and a
     * resource record set that has &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; for &lt;code&gt;CountryCode&lt;/code&gt; is
     * &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt;, which applies to all locations. If the endpoint for the state resource record set is
     * unhealthy, Route 53 checks for healthy resource record sets in the following order until it finds a resource
     * record set for which the endpoint is healthy:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;The United
     * States&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;North America&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;The

     * Endpoint by Domain Name&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If your health checks specify the endpoint only by domain
     * name, we recommend that you create a separate health check for each endpoint. For example, create a health check
     * for each &lt;code&gt;HTTP&lt;/code&gt; server that is serving content for

     * HealthCheckId&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Specifying a value for &lt;code&gt;HealthCheckId&lt;/code&gt; is
     * useful only when Route 53 is choosing between two or more resource record sets to respond to a DNS query, and you
     * want Route 53 to base the choice in part on the status of a health check. Configuring health checks makes sense
     * only in the following configurations:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Non-alias resource
     * record sets&lt;/b&gt;: You're checking the health of a group of non-alias resource record sets that have the same
     * routing policy, name, and type (such as multiple weighted records named www.example.com with a type of A) and you
     * specify health check IDs for all the resource record sets. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If the health check status for a
     * resource record set is healthy, Route 53 includes the record among the records that it responds to DNS queries
     * with.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If the health check status for a resource record set is unhealthy, Route 53 stops
     * responding to DNS queries using the value for that resource record set.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If the health check
     * status for all resource record sets in the group is unhealthy, Route 53 considers all resource record sets in the
     * group healthy and responds to DNS queries accordingly. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Alias
     * resource record sets&lt;/b&gt;: You specify the following settings:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;You
     * set &lt;code&gt;EvaluateTargetHealth&lt;/code&gt; to true for an alias resource record set in a group of resource
     * record sets that have the same routing policy, name, and type (such as multiple weighted records named
     * www.example.com with a type of A). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;You configure the alias resource
     * record set to route traffic to a non-alias resource record set in the same hosted zone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
     * &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;You specify a health check ID for the non-alias resource record set. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
     * &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;If the health check status is healthy, Route 53 considers the alias resource record set to
     * be healthy and includes the alias record among the records that it responds to DNS queries with.&lt;/p&gt;
     * &lt;p&gt;If the health check status is unhealthy, Route 53 stops responding to DNS queries using the alias
     * resource record set.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;note&gt; &lt;p&gt;The alias resource record set can also route traffic to a
     * &lt;i&gt;group&lt;/i&gt; of non-alias resource record sets that have the same routing policy, name, and type. In
     * that configuration, associate health checks with all of the resource record sets in the group of non-alias
     * resource record sets.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/note&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Geolocation
     * Routing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For geolocation resource record sets, if an endpoint is unhealthy, Route 53
     * looks for a resource record set for the larger, associated geographic region. For example, suppose you have
     * resource record sets for a state in the United States, for the entire United States, for North America, and a
     * resource record set that has &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; for &lt;code&gt;CountryCode&lt;/code&gt; is
     * &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt;, which applies to all locations. If the endpoint for the state resource record set is
     * unhealthy, Route 53 checks for healthy resource record sets in the following order until it finds a resource
     * record set for which the endpoint is healthy:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;The United
     * States&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;North America&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;The
     * default resource record set&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Specifying the Health Check
     * Endpoint by Domain Name&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If your health checks specify the endpoint only by domain
     * name, we recommend that you create a separate health check for each endpoint. For example, create a health check
     * for each &lt;code&gt;HTTP&lt;/code&gt; server that is serving content for
     * &lt;code&gt;www.example.com&lt;/code&gt;. For the value of &lt;code&gt;FullyQualifiedDomainName&lt;/code&gt;,
     * specify the domain name of the server (such as &lt;code&gt;us-east-2-www.example.com&lt;/code&gt;), not the name
     * of the resource record sets (&lt;code&gt;www.example.com&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;important&gt;
     * &lt;p&gt;Health check results will be unpredictable if you do the following:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;

     * the &lt;code&gt;Name&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Type&lt;/code&gt; elements as weighted resource record
     * sets.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can create a maximum of 100 weighted resource record sets
     * that have the same values for the &lt;code&gt;Name&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Type&lt;/code&gt;
     * elements.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;For weighted (but not weighted alias) resource record sets,
     * if you set &lt;code&gt;Weight&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; for a resource record set, Route 53
     * never responds to queries with the applicable value for that resource record set. However, if you set
     * &lt;code&gt;Weight&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; for all resource record sets that have the same
     * combination of DNS name and type, traffic is routed to all resources with equal probability.&lt;/p&gt;
     * &lt;p&gt;The effect of setting &lt;code&gt;Weight&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; is different when
     * you associate health checks with weighted resource record sets. For more information, see &lt;a
